i decided to shut down the matrix server that i launched recently
(see [previous post][1]).
here's my thoughts about this brief matrix experience.

<!--more-->

my main intention behind matrix server was to use it with my friends, but
almost nobody responded, so it's over.
synapse server is a bit resource heavy, so without it performance will be
better.

overall, matrix seemed like a good alternative to proprietary messengers to me.
it's ability to maintain group end-to-end encrypted rooms is very good and
also it was not so hard to set up.

the biggest con for me was that matrix is spamming all the chats with a huge
pile of system messages and notices. for example, all status changes of a
chat room are displayed as separate messages and i find this very annoying.
also, you can delete messages, but message deletion event is left forever in
the chat history.

maybe in future i will launch my server again
(i haven't purged all my configs).
