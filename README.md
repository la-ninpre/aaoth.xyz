# aaoth.xyz

repo of [aaoth.xyz](https://aaoth.xyz) website.

i have a lot of different creative projects so that i can't handle it in my
head. so i wish i'll be able to create some lightweight and simple website to
show as much of them as possible.

## implementation

i've decided to use [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) for this purpose, because
~~it's fun~~ it's pretty customizable and easy.

for my ease of use i added
[this git hook](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/deployment/automated/)
to my server-side git repository.
