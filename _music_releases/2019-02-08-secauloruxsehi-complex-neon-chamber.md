lyrics:

[verse 1]

intradimensional room that you can't feel  
rectangles, octagons, tesseract tissues aren't real  
obstacles glow in the solid shadow of fear (hear)  
voices that're piercing your eyes with the cracked mirror

[refrain]

*complex neon chamber  
dark and gloom invader  
chamber full of creatures  
they're dancing they're dancing  
they're moving in fire*

[verse 2]

colours out of sight, the crystallic tear (tears)  
changing the gravity's limbs, catch the cinder  
shockwave ambiguity chase to the northern wind -- see  
poles and parallel lines are aligning as vertical tinder

[refrain]
