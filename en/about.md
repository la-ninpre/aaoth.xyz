# hi, i'm la-ninpre

i'm creating some music and other stuff related to art, such as fonts, random
other pictures and occasional poems. style of my creations changed a lot over
time but it's always something unusual, non-professional and not meant to be
very popular.

since long time i tried to follow do-it-yourself principle, and this
website is an example of this. web-development (if you can call it like that)
is a new thing for me and primary reason of me doing this is probably some
kind of web-presence. other important thing for me is the ability to create
anything i want and make things look how i want them to look. for comparison,
none of the popular social platforms can give me this ability.

i'm also very interested in sciences (especially biology, chemistry and
linguistics). i speak russian, speak english a little bit and also toki pona :D

pona tawa sina!

[here's a list of links to other people's websites i find interesting](/links/)

## contact

how you can contact me? well, here's a list in order of preference
(and in order of increasing response time probably).

if you want to send me an encrypted message or verify my signatures on commits
or files, here are my cryptographic keys.

[pgp key 405c2c163ef6a2c9](/files/crypto/la_ninpre_405c2c163ef6a2c9.asc)

[signify key la_ninpre-2023.pub](/files/crypto/la_ninpre-2023.pub)

### fediverse

fedi is probably a fastest way to reach me. i have multiple accounts,
here they are.

* la_ninpre at merveilles dot town

* lnpr at bloat dot aaoth dot xyz

* la_ninpre at mstdn dot starnix dot network

* la_ninpre at lamp dot leemoon dot network

* la_ninpre at berserker dot town

* la_ninpre at mk dot starnix dot network

* lan_lewa at toki dot social

### email

email is old, but cool. if you want to send a pgp-encrypted message,
my public key is available above.

* aaoth at aaoth dot xyz

### xmpp

xmpp is old too, but it works well. if you want to send me an omemo-encrypted
message, the list of signed omemo keys is down below. use my pgp key to verify
the signatures. keys signed with signify(1) are in the same locations,
but with .sig suffix instead of .asc.

* la_ninpre at aaoth dot xyz

[cryptoshizo gajim fingerprint](/files/crypto/omemo-csc-gajim.asc)

### irc

i'm barely active on irc, but still you could probably reach me there.

* la-ninpre on libera.chat

* la-ninpre on esper.net

* lnpr on irc.ilita.i2p
