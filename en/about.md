# hi, i'm la-ninpre

i'm creating some music and other stuff related to art, such as fonts, random
other pictures and occasional poems. style of my creations changed a lot over
time but it's always something unusual, non-professional and not meant to be
very popular.

since long time i tried to follow do-it-yourself principle, and this
website is an example of this. web-development (if you can call it like that)
is a new thing for me and primary reason of me doing this is probably some
kind of web-presence. other important thing for me is the ability to create
anything i want and make things look how i want them to look. for comparison,
none of the popular social platforms can give me this ability.

i'm also very interested in sciences (especially biology, chemistry and
linguistics). i speak russian, speak english a little bit and also toki pona :D

pona tawa sina!
