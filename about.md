# hi, i'm la-ninpre

i am also known as aaoth or lev brekalov.

i was thinking a lot about the reason i have so many names, but i could'n find
a clear answer. maybe i'll try to make myself up somehow, but now it's messy.

anyway, since long time i tried to follow do-it-yourself principle, and this
website is an example of this. web-development (if you can call it like that)
is a new thing for me and primary reason of me doing this is probably some
kind of web-presence. other important thing for me is the ability to create
anything i want and make things look how i want them to look. for comparison,
none of the popular social platforms can give me this ability.

i'm creating some music and other stuff related to art, such as fonts, random
other pictures and occasional poems. style of my creations changed a lot over
time but it's always something unusual, non-professional and not meant to be
very popular.

i'm also very interested in sciences (especially biology, chemistry and
linguistics). i speak russian, speak a little bit english and also
[toki pona](https://tokipona.org) :D

last year i've been diving into world of unix-related software and operating
systems, namely gnu/linux and openbsd. for all past years i've been a windows
user, but then i realized that many things are more comfortable in
unix userland.
additionally, it's important for me to understand *what* exactly i'm doing, and
the last thing is nearly impossible in closed oses like windows or mac.

pona tawa sina!
